The Micro:bit Educational Foundation is a nonprofit inspiring children globally to embrace digital skills through innovative hardware, software, and free educational resources. Originating from the BBC's Make It Digital initiative in 2014, they've impacted over 44 million young learners in 60+ countries, fostering diversity in STEM education and creating pathways to a brighter digital future. If you would like to learn more about Micro:bit here is their website: https://microbit.org. 

Purpose:
This app facilitates seamless data collection using the Micro:bit device and a mobile device, enabling wireless data retrieval via Bluetooth and efficient data logging. Whether deployed in diverse environments or for varying durations, users can effortlessly set up their Micro:bit device and subsequently connect to the mobile app to gather all stored data.

Setup Instructions:
The app itself will work without any additional setup, but this section will pertain to what you need to setup in the Makecode editor so the app can correctly interface with the Micro:bit device. Here is the link to the makecode editor https://makecode.microbit.org/#.
